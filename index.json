Chen\nPublisher: Addison-Wesley Professional\nRelease Date: January 2018\nISBN: 9780135170199\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pandas-data-cleaning/9780135170199/\nVideo Description The perfect follow up to Pandas Data Analysis with Python Fundamentals LiveLessons for the aspiring data scientist\nOverview In Pandas Data Cleaning and Modeling with Python LiveLessons, Daniel Y. Chen builds upon the foundation he built in Pandas Data Analysis with Python Fundamentals LiveLessons. In this LiveLesson Dan teaches you the techniques and skills you need to know to be able to clean and process your data. Dan shows you how to do data munging using some of the built-in Python libraries that can be used to clean data loaded into Pandas. Once your data is clean you are going to want to analyze it, so next Dan introduces you to other libraries that are used for model fitting.\nSkill Level Beginner to Intermediate\nLearn How To Use pandas data types Convert data types Use string methods and regular expressions Apply functions to data Aggregate, transform, and filter data Use pandas and Python date and time methods Model data\nWho Should Take This Course Those new to data science, particularly those with Python programming experience\nCourse Requirements Basic programming skills, particularly in Python\nLesson Descriptions Lesson 1: Pandas Data Types These lessons pick up where Pandas Data Analysis with Python Fundamentals LiveLessons left off. You learned the basics of subsetting, combining, and reshaping data. Now you can start learning how to cleaning your data. That begins with learning data types and how to find them in your data. Next comes the converting from one type to another, including converting data into numeric and string values. The lesson finishes with categorical data.\nLesson 2: Unstructured Text and Strings in Pandas There are vast stores of data available as unstructured text. Understanding how to work with text data in Python is important when your dataset has text data that needs to be processed. The lesson begins with a basic overview of strings and the built-in python string methods. Next, Dan covers how to format strings. This will make your code more legible and can make the output more consistent and “prettier.” Dan then introduces regular expressions with the built-in regular expressions library (2.5) and how you can use regular expressions to do pattern matching. Finally, Dan shows you a quick example of the better, but not built-in, regex library.\nLesson 3: Applying Functions to Data Applying functions is a fundamental skill when working with data. Application of functions incorporates many skills used in programming and data analytics. Instead of writing for loops to perform calculations and data manipulations, we write functions that work on a column-by-column or row-by-row basis. Dan begins with a quick introduction to functions in Python. Then, he turns to using simple functions on a toy dataset to see how apply works. Next, he applies functions on an actual dataset. You then learn how to write vectorized functions, functions that work on an element-wise basis. Finally, Dan takes a look at lambda functions for one-off calculations.\nLesson 4: Breaking Up Computations Using groupby Operations: split-apply-combine groupby operations follow the mantra of split-apply-combine. Where your data is split and partitioned by a variable or variables, functions are applied to each partition, and the results are combined back into a single result. This technique is utilized heavily on distributed systems when the data no longer can fit on a single machine. There are three common operations when performing a groupby. First, there is aggregation where you summarize your data into a single value. For example, calculating the average life expectancy across each year in your data would be aggregation. Transformation is done when you perform a specific calculation for each individual group. Next, there is filtration, where you reduce your data based on a calculation within a group.\nDan also looks further into the groupby object itself and how you can iterate over your groups. And finally, he demonstrates the multi-index and how you can chain multiple groupby calculations together.\nLesson 5: Dates and Times in Python and Pandas One of pandas’ strong suits is handling dates and times in time-series data. There are many convenient functions and methods that make working and processing datetime data much easier in pandas. Dan begins by looking at Python’s datetime object and how to create them. Next, you learn how you can convert columns in your data into datetime objects. He then shows you how you can directly load data into a datetime without having an intermediate step and then convert it later. Once you have your data stored as a proper date and time object, Dan shows you how you can extract various datetime components and how you can perform calculations and create Timedeltas. Then Dan shows you other functions and methods you can perform on datetimes, and how you can download stock data from the internet. Once you have your data processed the way you want, Dan takes you back to the basics and you learn how you can leverage dates and times to subset your data. From there you learn how you can create ranges of dates, followed by an example of shifting date values. Finally, Dan covers how you can resample your dates and how you can convert dates and times across various time zones.\nLesson 6: Modeling: Connecting to the World Outside of Pandas Once you have your data processed the way you want, you can begin modeling your data to gain insights. This lesson begins to expand our world within pandas to other Python libraries used to model data. Dan begins with linear regression and how it is performed in two very popular modeling libraries: statsmodels and scikit-learn. While linear regression is great if your outcome or response variable is continuous, you can use logistic regression when your outcome of interest is a binary variable. When you begin working with count data, you use a Poisson or negative binomial model, depending on the assumptions and characteristics of your data. Next, Dan introduces you to survival models, when you have censored data and want to model the time a particular event will occur. Dan then covers how you can perform model diagnostics and compare model performance by looking at residuals, ANOVA, AIC, BIC, and k-fold cross validation. He then covers how you can have a more parsimonious model that can better predict future data points by using regularization techniques, and the lesson concludes by introducing clustering techniques and how you can use principal components analysis to visualize your k-means results.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561957487,"objectID":"b8c80d8d1b46fe46938dbe3f6a733e86","permalink":"/courses/python/pandas_ml_video/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/python/pandas_ml_video/","section":"courses","summary":"Pandas Data Cleaning and Modeling with Python\nby Daniel Y.

In fact, it is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This course will equip you with all the skills you need to clean your data in Python, from learning how to diagnose your data for problems to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course, you\u0026rsquo;ll apply all of the techniques you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to a case study in which you\u0026rsquo;ll clean a real-world Gapminder dataset!\nExploring your data So you\u0026rsquo;ve just got a brand new dataset and are itching to start exploring it. But where do you begin, and how can you be sure your dataset is clean? This chapter will introduce you to the world of data cleaning in Python! You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to explore your data with an eye for diagnosing issues such as outliers, missing values, and duplicate rows.\nTidying data for analysis Here, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn about the principles of tidy data and more importantly, why you should care about them and how they make subsequent data analysis more efficient. You\u0026rsquo;ll gain first hand experience with reshaping and tidying your data using techniques such as pivoting and melting.\nCombining data for analysis The ability to transform and combine your data is a crucial skill in data science, because your data may not always come in one monolithic file or table for you to load. A large dataset may be broken into separate datasets to facilitate easier storage and sharing. Or if you are dealing with time series data, for example, you may have a new dataset for each day. No matter the reason, it is important to be able to combine datasets so you can either clean a single dataset, or clean each dataset separately and then combine them later so you can run your analysis on a single dataset. In this chapter, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn all about combining data.\nCleaning data for analysis Here, you\u0026rsquo;ll dive into some of the grittier aspects of data cleaning. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn about string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data, and then explore techniques to deal with missing or duplicate data. You\u0026rsquo;ll also learn the valuable skill of programmatically checking your data for consistency, which will give you confidence that your code is running correctly and that the results of your analysis are reliable!\nCase study In this final chapter, you\u0026rsquo;ll apply all of the data cleaning techniques you\u0026rsquo;ve learned in this course towards tidying a real-world, messy dataset obtained from the Gapminder Foundation.

This is essentially the code that R will execute. It is similar to the “string” that will be executed, but an actual string in R will return a string, not a command or set of instructions that R will execute.\nCompare:\n3 + 3 ## [1] 6 Which will return the executed result of 3 + 3 and\n\u0026quot;3 + 3\u0026quot; ## [1] \u0026quot;3 + 3\u0026quot; which will return the string \"3 + 3\"\nwith:\nquote(3 + 3) ## 3 + 3 which returns the expression 3 + 3 that is the instruction to R without actually evaluating it.\nIf we wanted to evaluate the expression, we can call eval.\neval(quote(3 + 3)) ## [1] 6 You can read more about expressions in the Expressions Chapter in Advanced R.\n The “bug” The bug was detected in gradethis where we want to compare student submitted code with the instructor solution. There are multiple steps in the comparison process, but the first step is to simply check if the two bits of code are the same. That way, we can stop there and not have to go through the process to detect where the actual differences are.\nThe comparison code was originally written to use == to compare the expressions.\nuser \u0026lt;- quote(3 + 3) solution \u0026lt;- quote(3 + 3) user == solution ## [1] TRUE Garrett Grolemund put in a bunch of examples that show some weird behaviour. I initially thought it had to do with name spacing the function name, or after using the : notation to select columns in a dataframe via tidyselect.\nWhen the two expressions are the same, we get TRUE as expected\n# supposed to return TRUE u \u0026lt;- quote(tidyr::gather(key = key, value = value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE)) s \u0026lt;- quote(tidyr::gather(key = key, value = value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE)) u == s ## [1] TRUE But when we change the values for na.rm, we also get TRUE when the expressions are not the same.\n# supposed to return FALSE u \u0026lt;- quote(tidyr::gather(key = key, value = value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE)) s \u0026lt;- quote(tidyr::gather(key = key, value = value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = FALSE)) u == s ## [1] TRUE But it seems if we get rid of the tidyselect column selector, we get the correct result.\n# If we remove the third argument the error goes away u \u0026lt;- quote(tidyr::gather(key = key, value = value, na.rm = TRUE)) s \u0026lt;- quote(tidyr::gather(key = key, value = value, na.rm = FALSE)) u == s ## [1] FALSE I brought this up on our daily shiny-core stand-ups and Winston Chang thought it may have something to do with the deparse function since it doesn’t actually matter what the expressions being compared are.\nu \u0026lt;- quote(f(x123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890, 1)) s \u0026lt;- quote(f(x123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890, 2)) u == s ## [1] TRUE You can see Winston’s comment and link to R code in question here.\nPretty much when == is used to compare expressions, the expressions are passed through deparse. When deparse is run on an expression, it breaks it up into vectors that are 60L characters long, which is fine, but the R bug is when the comparison is only performed with the first element of the vector. That’s why only the end of the expressions seem to “not matter”.\n Reporting the bug I reported the findings to the r-devel mailing list\nWhere, even after botching my first listserv submission, I got a response from Martin Maechler (R-core)\n Looking at that and its context, I think we (R core) should reconsider that implementation of ‘==’ which indeed does about the same thing as deparse {which also truncates at some point by default; something very very reasonable for error messages, but undesirable in other cases}.\nBut I think it’s fair expectation that comparing calls [“language”] with ‘==’ should compare the full call’s syntax even if that may occasionally be very long.\n So it is actually a behavior that will get patched one day.\n The fix We ended up making changes to gradethis by using identical() while comparing quoted expressions.\nu \u0026lt;- quote(f(x123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890, 1)) s \u0026lt;- quote(f(x123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890, 2)) identical(u, s) ## [1] FALSE Using identical() is a much better way when we are comparing code and results, because == will return a matrix when comparing 2 dataframes where using all has problems when there are NA missing values.\nWe want to see if the 2 vectors are the same\nu \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, 3) s \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, NA) all(u == s) ## [1] NA We can remove missing values, but now when either the user code or solution code does contains an NA it gets ignored.\nu \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, 3) s \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, NA) all(u == s, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] TRUE u \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, NA) s \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, 3) all(u == s, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] TRUE Now, we nudge toward using identical and raise a warning when we detect ==.\nu \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, NA) s \u0026lt;- c(1, 2, 3) identical(u, s) ## [1] FALSE Does Donald Knuth owe me a dollar now?\n ","date":1565049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565098349,"objectID":"df67ae366d7beb9b3bb324244310d085","permalink":"/2019/08/06/inconsistencies-with-in-r/","publishdate":"2019-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/08/06/inconsistencies-with-in-r/","section":"post","summary":"One of the cool things about working on gradethis (grader need to be renamed) is that we end up doing things that aren’t common in R (i.e., grading and comparing code).\nI discovered an inconsistency with the == operator when comparing (long) R expressions.\nA quick primer on expressions In R, you can create an expression using the quote() function.

Metaprogramming and non-standard evaluation (NSE) in R Four 1-hour workshops by Allison Hill on the summer-of-blogdown  moving things over from jekyll will take some time   So many of the random things I\u0026rsquo;ve tinkered with in the past have come front and center. As an educator, I know seeing these things again make learning and understanding them easier. You build on your previous knowledge to solidify, fix, and fill in gaps in your mental model. The process repeats until you get an understanding about a topic.\nFor me, I\u0026rsquo;m getting a better foundation to how NSE works and how it all plays together within the Tidyverse.\nGit I got some things merged!\nThe pull-request that was broken and merged on my first day finally was fixed and merged. I also got to work with the lintr package and merged it into grader too.\nThis week was probably the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve used git amend in a long time (if ever?). I\u0026rsquo;ve typically always just made the commit, and run git rebase -i to squash and/or amend my commits. I can see why common operations like making changes to the previous commit would have a shortcut. I typically don\u0026rsquo;t use these features because it\u0026rsquo;s another thing to teach, and understanding git rebase -i is more general than git commit --amend.\nWhat --amend allows you to do is replace the previous git commit with another one. You can fix the commit message, or add/fix file you missed. Theses are all ways to make the commit history cleaner.\nThe recipe looks like this:\ngit add \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; git commit --amend \u0026lt;Fix/modify the commit message\u0026gt; git push -f origin master  The last line does a -f force push, because the commit is actually different from the one before you --amended.\nR package versions There\u0026rsquo;s a convention about version numbering adding a .9000+ after the patch (e.g., v0.1.4.9000) to show a a development version number. You can couple this with the DESCRIPTION file by forcing a particular version to make sure you and the team all have access to the same development features.\nI came across this in grader that has a Imports for learnr (\u0026gt;= 0.9.2.9001).\ngrader progress We\u0026rsquo;re probably going to change the name of the package to gradethis because the package gradeR (note capital R) was submitted to CRAN right as I started.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I learned about the library I\u0026rsquo;m working on this week:\n learnr set\u0026rsquo;s the checker function  In the knitr chunk exercise.checker specifies the checker function  tutorial_options(exercise.timelimit = 60, exercise.checker = grade_learnr)  In this example, grade_learnr is the main entrypoint from learnr to grader and my work starts with this function.  checker is called on line 129 in exercise.R in learnr  the checker function (i.e., grade_learnr) returns a value depending on what is passed into it  if missing: returns a list() with message, correct, type, and location keys if error: graded object (named checked_result of class grader_graded) with correct and message or evaluated code    There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of stuff within the exercise.R function in learnr that captures information from shiny, sets up the knitr environment, and inserts the output and results into the correct place in the DOM. That\u0026rsquo;ll be a separate writeup when I leave the grader world.\nFor the next week or so the goal is to update the check_result API, which got me down the rabbit hole of non-standard evaluation in R (I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it in a separate set of posts).\nNon-standard Evaluation (NSE) I gave a talk about writing functions in R which touched on NSE but it was pretty superficial. Since NSE is so crucial to grader I\u0026rsquo;ll write a series of posts about this topic and eventually turn it into a talk.\nIn the meantime, here are the materials (in no particular order) I\u0026rsquo;ll be reading to:\n https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/ https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/ggplot2-in-packages.html#using-aes-and-vars-in-a-package-function https://adv-r.hadley.nz/  Misc Other random things I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered this week\ndplyr::count vs dplyr::tally From the docs:\n tally() is a convenient wrapper for summarise that will either call n() or sum(n) depending on whether you\u0026rsquo;re tallying for the first time, or re-tallying. count() is similar but calls group_by() before and ungroup() after. If the data is already grouped, count() adds an additional group that is removed afterwards.\n dplyr::count can count observations with 0 counts (useful for group_by operations) with the .drop argument\npryr::standarise_call Manipulating the function call is black magic NSE voodoo. This is the stuff that is happening within grader that gets student code, solution code, learnr and grader arguments that are all passed into grade_learnr.\n# code below was copy/pasted from the console my_add \u0026lt;- function(x, y) { x + y } # pass in part of an expression call \u0026lt;- pryr::standardise_call(quote(my_add(x = 3))) # on the fly add more parameters! call$y \u0026lt;- 10 # evaluate the thing eval(call) ## [1] 13  This all uses the global environment, but grader will be doing this type of thing with separate environments for each exercise that will be checked.\nAlso, this is all how match.call works in base R.\ncheckmate package There is a package called checkmate that is unit testing (e.g., testthat) on steroids. It allows you to more specific type and argument checking in R. I haven\u0026rsquo;t work with the package personally yet, but it does seem to be like type hints in Python and allows more specific checks into what objects in R contain.\nCredentials One of the coolest things about being an intern at RStudio is being on the slack channel! I try to keep my questions reserved but one of the things that have always bothered me was how store and access credentials for R. Putting in API keys in .Renviron are common practice, but I piggy-backed on another intern\u0026rsquo;s question by asking about storing passwords more securely than in a plain text file.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used the rstudioapi, secret, and getPass libraries before, but as Raymond Hettinger always says: There must be a better way.\nThe resource I was given was to look at how database credentials are stored: https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/managing-credentials/\nSummer of blog down Lastly, the great Allison Hill hosted a series of blogdown workshops for people who were interested, summer-of-blogdown. It was a total of 4 days and we covered the basics of blogdown, how to pick (the academic) themes, deploying it on netlify, and best ways to maintain the site.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t realize how amazingly flexible the academic theme was until this workshop. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to move my own website over to blogdown + academic one of these days.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently trying to find out how to save urls in a common location so they can be maintained in one place and be used in links throughout the site. The ongoing search for how to use variables in an md document (tl;dr: you can\u0026rsquo;t, but you might still be able to do what I want): https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/variables-in-markdown/7113/12. It almost seemed that site variables were going to be the way to go, but that ended up in a dead end.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m most excited about is the ability to write posts in Rmd and jupyter notebooks for R and Python posts.\nThings I\u0026rsquo;ve learned the 4 days:\n Each folder in content is a \u0026ldquo;section\u0026rdquo; and each \u0026ldquo;section\u0026rdquo; has a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; /content/home/ contain widgets Learn x in y minutes website for TOML From Greg Wilson: Put a LICENSE and CITATION + orcid on your website.

It\u0026rsquo;s an unbelievable opportunity and I\u0026rsquo;ve been half panicked and fighting imposter syndrome since the announcement was made in March. My meeting with Greg Wilson on Friday (2019-06-07) went something like this:\nGreg Wilson: How's the internship going? Me: I'm panicked, but really excited. Greg Wilson: Good. That's how interns should feel.  I\u0026rsquo;m working on the grader package (with Garrett Grolemund and Barret Schloerke) which aims to check code against a solution. This package integrates with the learnr package, that allows an RMarkdown document to be run as an interactive tutorial (more on this after the break).\nMy internship began with a broken pull request that needs to be fixed.\nThe learnr/grader packages learnr allows users to write interactive tutorials/lessons (using RMarkdown) that give instructors to write interactive tutorials (using shiny). Learners will be able to follow the tutorial write and execute R code that will be graded. Under the hood, learnr is an RMarkdown document with runtime: shiny. This allows the user (e.g., instructor) to write tutorials using markdown and provide solutions using code chunks and all the magic of capturing and checking the answer with shiny and grader.\nThere are two main ways code can be graded.\n Comparing results Comparing the provided student code with the solution code (i.e., strict checking).  One way this can be done is by looking at the abstract syntax tree. Another way would be some fancy set of string matching / regular expressions.   When I started, there were some API changes that were made and I\u0026rsquo;ve spent my first week going down various rabbit holes fixing tests and getting R CMD check to pass. Barret has been super helpful and supportive by walking me through the code base and helping me fix the broken things. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure he did all the work in my PR.\nGeneral goals for the summer This will be a moving target, but it seems like after the first week these may be good goals for the summer:\n A (pkgdown) vignette for the grader user API and a separate one for the developer API. Blog post of how learnr works, and what order to expect error messages (see use-case maps). Put together a grader example without the use of learnr  An example would be to pass grader 2 R scripts (the student code and the solution code). This came up while I was talking to Greg and he brought up \u0026ldquo;Working Effectively with Legacy Code\u0026rdquo; by Michael Feathers  This will help me find the entry points to the package, write isolated tests, and have a clearer goal of the project. Along with use-case maps, this will help me be a better software developer and understand what\u0026rsquo;s actually going on (did I mention I\u0026rsquo;m half panicked and fighting imposter syndrome?)    Other goals would be to have:\n Virtual coffee meetings with other people in the company (there\u0026rsquo;s a channel called \u0026ldquo;virtual-donut\u0026rdquo; that has a scheduler bot) See if I can draft up and hunt down the people for a PhD topic.  Greg really planted a seed in my head a few months ago about putting together materials to help \u0026ldquo;front-line health practitioners (e.g., nurse and general practitioners) use and understand data\u0026rdquo;. I think I can\u0026hellip; I think I can\u0026hellip; I think I can\u0026hellip;   Random things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so far  I think I really like this 100% remote work schedule, I\u0026rsquo;ve been up way earlier than usual finishing things before a morning meeting and then taking my time the rest of the day planning and implementing things.  I also feel like a teenager in chatrooms talking to everyone (thanks Slack!)  Using Templates with Roxygen2: allows roxygen2 docstrings to be reused by using a @template Rd keyword Use-case maps: document and show the various components of an application, but also show what components are used for a given action  This would be great for learnr and grader since I\u0026rsquo;ll pretty much be doing this for myself just to figure out all the moving parts of the system and how each component works in the full application.  lintr: is a way to do static code analysis in R.  You can use this to check for (potential) errors before runtime Pretty sure I can take the same idea and apply it to grader  All these years practicing my Git-fu seems to be paying off. My mentor, Garrett Grolemund, is RStudio employee number insert number that can be represented with 1 hand :O There\u0026rsquo;s an \u0026ldquo;emoji-psa\u0026rdquo; channel at RStudio. It\u0026rsquo;s active. People really know their emojis. owo  Misc  I\u0026rsquo;ve given up trying to sync the GSuite with Thunderbird and having a unified calendar.  I\u0026rsquo;m using openWMail again for my RStudio calendar/drive. Still have all my emails in Thunderbird.  Not all the interns started on the same date. Most of us started June 3rd, but some started earlier and others will start later.  Us interns have our own slack workspace! We had our first interns-only coffee chat on Friday.  Malcolm Barrett, Julia Blum, Joyce Cahoon, Desiree De Leon, Dewey Dunnington, and Maya Gans all met this week.

Conversely, one of the more satisfying things is running a script that you are not actively working on and have it run without problems.\nProject Templates are one way to address this problem. The original post about project templates mainly talks about the folder structure but not so much as the rationale behind why things are the way they are. Also the original post used a user-based subfolder structure under src, which caused some problems when we ended up doing code reviews.\nWhy do we even want to use \u0026ldquo;projects\u0026rdquo;? Software Carpentry has a good set of explanations. When dealing with working directories and workspaces within R and RStudio, even RStudio suggests using projects.\nHopefully the links above are convincing enough to use projects and some standardized folder structure within projects. Below are some of the issues we\u0026rsquo;ve encountered while working on various projects, and hopefully we can slowly migrate to a standardization for all projects and analysis moving forward. Some of the problems and solutions are already mentioned from the Software-Carpentry and RStudio links above.\nProblems  Manually setting a working directory in a script.  Reduces the reproducibility by hard-coding a path specific to each user. When sharing code, each person needs to manually edit at least one line within the file to set the working directory. Results and other saved outputs from code are also tied to the working directory  Sharing code within a project by copy/pasting from another script.  Redundant routines in code should always be encapsulated into a function so they can be re-used within a script and shared across scripts. Since duplication of code is minimized, a fix in one location should provide the same fix in other locations. We\u0026rsquo;ve had situations where code was copy/pasted into multiple scripts and multiple bugs were introduced/fixed in multiple places but neither set of duplicated code contained all the bug fixes.  Username subfolders in the src folder  Promoted code duplication and made it hard to find a particular analysis. Originally set up this way to minimize merge conflicts Individuals can quickly find his/her own work Became a problem because instead of sharing code that needed to be reused, people started copy/pasting code into scripts See duplication of code problem from the previous point During the code review process, finding code that did a certain task was difficult since it was organized by who did a task, versus the task itself.  Manually setting working directories while under a version control systems (VCS)  VCS keep track of changes from files. Even if there is a general understanding of manually setting a working directory among collaborators, every time someone changes the working directory to run on their machine, the version control system will report a change in the file. While the changes can be reverted by the VCS, it\u0026rsquo;s an unnecessary step in the work flow, and can lead to unwanted changes in the code if a file was reverted unexpectedly. Or you will end up with the same lines and files being changed over and over, cluttering the log and history.   Solutions Many of these problems can be solved with using RStudio Projects.\n Prevents scripts from setting a working directory (setwd())  The working directory will be the root of the project. Since the starting point for each script is deterministic, we can implement a folder structure within the project in a way where data has a common access point (e.g., ./data/path/to/data) and code that needs to be run will also have a common access point (e.g., ./src/path/to/script.R)  Code and scripts can be easily be referenced from the root working directory of the project  When someone wants to create a script to hold functions, it has a consistent path to be sourced in another R script This would provide a place for common code bases to be shared without copy/pasting into multiple scripts and without having to be put into a proper R package.  The structure of the project template needs to account for multiple people entering and leaving a project at various points during the lifetime of a project  We have a src folder so people knew where to put his/her R scripts needed a way to organize the folder so we don\u0026rsquo;t have 10s or 100s of files in a single directory. We initially settled on using user name sub-folders.  This prevented a lot of potential merge conflicts, since people are more likely to just work in their own directory but it also caused people to copy/paste from other people\u0026rsquo;s folders. It also made it difficult to find out later on how to find a particular piece of analytics. We would have to know who worked on it to find the script, versus looking up the analysis itself.  Thus, we are moving to a naming system not under user names.  This also will prevent copy/pasting of common code bases. One thing that can happen is more merge conflicts (editing the same line of a file at the same time) while working  but even that can be minimized by coordinating efforts.    Reduces the Git history clutter  Version control systems (VCS) keep track of changes within a file. When we have working directories manually being set on a user-by-user basis, each user will have to set his/her own working directory to get the script to run. This requires commenting out the current working directory set in the code, and either replacing or uncommenting out the \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo; working directory. This will cause the VCS to note there is a change in a file where the user either needs to commit or revert for each person who is running the script. While this may be a \u0026lsquo;harmless\u0026rsquo; change, it clutters the log and history of the file, when bigger changes need to be reverted or bugs need to be tracked down. The project template should also fix this problem since the working directory no longer needs to be set in the file.   Changes to mindset Section taken from feedback from Ian\nGit The major change from using username src subfolders to analysis-based subfolders is how to navigate the initial hierarchies of the folder. While the most technical hurdle to overcome is the potential of increased Git merge conflicts, it can be minimized by coordinating efforts. We have a system that distinguishes code from data, where code is stored on a Git server (e.g., GitLab) and data is stored on an encrypted LUKS volume. This means learning and using Git will have to be part of everyone\u0026rsquo;s toolkit. It\u0026rsquo;s a technical solution to solve a very complex problem, sharing and version controlling files, but it does offer solutions for project management, if you choose to use it.\nCode structure  The most appealing part of using usernames as folders is that it allows users to think of their code however they like, and never need to reconcile that with other people\u0026rsquo;s understanding of project structure. For instance, Alice can organize folders by the work she did on a month to month basis. Bob can organize scripts into data processing/data loading/plots/misc. Chris can structure code based on who asked her to do whatever. Each person has a system that works for them and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to work for anyone else. But even in this small example, the three code bases are conceptually incompatible. How do you reconcile folders called \u0026lsquo;June2017\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;get ACS stuff\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;For Sallie\u0026rsquo;? In a project-centered folder structure, everyone needs to be on more or less the same page regarding the structure of the project and what goes on in it. Personally I think this is a good thing, and something we should be doing anyway, but it will certainly be a challenge especially if people don\u0026rsquo;t think to think of it. ```\n ","date":1516665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"2a071fd29bdb31102261ce89dd313d1f","permalink":"/2018/01/23/analysis-based-project-templates/","publishdate":"2018-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2018/01/23/analysis-based-project-templates/","section":"post","summary":"One of the most annoying things you hear people say when they are working with some common code base is \u0026ldquo;It works on my machine\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.

From what I remember, we started using Virtual Box virtual machines, then moved to LXC Linux containers, and we are now rebuilding our entire infrastructure using Docker containers.\nHow we got here The whole point of using these visualization and container technologies is so we did not want to install anything directly on the server. There are many benefits to this\n If the server goes down, we should be able to redeploy our infrastructure on a backup server If an installation goes wrong, it will not crash the underlying server  If an installation goes wrong, we should be able to swap out or roll back to a working state  This gives us the ability to test out updates before rolling them out on a production server If something happens with one part of the system, it should not affect another  Virtual Box Virtual Machines We (Aaron) started with Virtual Box Virtual Machines, because it\u0026rsquo;s a very logical first step. If you wanted the same thing on your own computer/laptop, you\u0026rsquo;d use a virtual machine. This meant that it was relatively easy to get started because we already had experience with VB.\nOur main reasons for looking into other solutions were\n performance: since we are using these VMs to run data analytics, we needed performant system. The fact we needed to install an entire OS made it clunky size: Since we wanted multiple containers, one for each application, the fact that an entire OS needed to be installed for each application meant that a lot of OS information was replicated and used a large amount of space VBoxManage: since we had to run our VMs in headless mode, the only way to make changes to the VMs was with the VB command line tool, VBoxManage, which is less than ideal in terms of simplicity and documentation.  LXC Containers When looking to move away from VirtualBox, we started with LXC because at the time Docker just started and didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be developed enough. During the early days of Docker, the documentation was lacking (one might argue that it still is), and the API/interface was cumbersome (How do I get into my container? why can\u0026rsquo;t I just SSH?). We went with LXC since docker was an extension of it. We later also looked into LXD, since it extended LXC with more and better security, group, and permission features.\nLXC got us pretty far, we had a lighter set of applications running on the servers, since each container was based on the host operating system (in our case this was CenOS 7).\nThe main issue was that it was hard to quickly tear down and redeploy containers. Or have container dependencies to build applications.\n support: support for LXC was lacking, mainly a lack of documentation permissions: permissions from the host were not being carried over into the container host os: each container was limited to whatever the host OS was on.  These limitations had us looking at LXD, LXC successor. LXD did not run as root, so each container was not privileged. It also mapped permissions from the host OS, and we had the ability to install an image using Ubuntu, if needed.\nHowever, after a year we transitioned into Docker, and solved the LXC limitations.\nDocker Containers I\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of the issues from LXC could\u0026rsquo;ve been worked out with enough blood, sweat, and tears, it is linux after all. The popularity of Docker over the year was hard to ignore and worth trying again.\nThe best part about docker is how it forces you to fully document the setup process, using the Dockerfile. This not only meant that we can readily tear down and spin up the container if something goes wrong. Additionally, we can just as easily start up multiple containers running the same application. This is particularly useful when trying to get RStudio to see newly mounted and mapped drives or permission changes. Instead of restarting the image, which requires nobody to be using it, we can spin up a new container and have the people who needed new data partitions or permission to have a temporary new container without disrupting other users.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? We\u0026rsquo;ll probably look into container orchestration tools such as docker-swarm or kubernetes. While we could use the current docker-compose file and function to create multiple RStudio Servers, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of copying and pasting involved.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d like everyone to have his/her own RStudio instance, so if there is a permission change, we can simply restart the individual user\u0026rsquo;s container instance, rather than finding workarounds in the middle of the day because we can\u0026rsquo;t do a restart. Relying on zero usage on a server (especially in the middle of a work day) to do maintenance is almost never a good idea. Having a orchestrator will allow us to spin up as many instances without conflicting ports and username-appended container names with a single script.\nIt would also be nice to have a single entry page, so users can pick the service they need, rather than remembering port numbers to connect to (since those can change at any given time).\nFinally, on a recent server hiccup, we were having issues around dead containers.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the error message when we tried to stop and remove the containers:\n$ docker-compose down Stopping adminer ... done Stopping mro ... done Stopping postgresql ... done Stopping dokuwiki ... done Stopping rpkgs ... done Stopping rstudio ... done Stopping shiny ... done Removing adminer ... error Removing mro ... error Removing postgresql ... error Removing dokuwiki ... error Removing rpkgs ... error Removing rstudio ... error Removing shiny ... error ERROR: for postgresql driver \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; failed to remove root filesystem for b91b18c144d40801b1782789ffe3a9352509b720b368947cefd9e443d02edf01: remove /home/vms/docker/overlay/014f942314a693d1984155ded44a30f50b27b67fce62f7ed60233028f998379c/merged: device or resource busy ERROR: for dokuwiki driver \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; failed to remove root filesystem for f228cc35d050d8654cc1eb4e424feb111a2b826b3a4bd35d42aa4ff38dcc5524: remove /home/vms/docker/overlay/6dc15c5116a0290bc42bdae7fafdcbdcf718951c8ebcbfbc63eb56d18fd07c23/merged: device or resource busy ERROR: for adminer driver \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; failed to remove root filesystem for fb7f33ed5a10a843b9855ffa3aa83c0b68ecfeb793a89274e0277add2bc08262: remove /home/vms/docker/overlay/58c311625ca5d6288359489d36c4653107fd710e3700298cf8400cf85d4c4523/merged: device or resource busy ERROR: for rpkgs driver \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; failed to remove root filesystem for 14c0516130623640ebace03e89478b17efb2e802232ddc22a524f42e4fcaef02: remove /home/vms/docker/overlay/d083c1fb3046605fe3a9eaa8e19111b00473c38bebe23f222bfd0cfa81802c6f/merged: device or resource busy ERROR: for mro driver \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; failed to remove root filesystem for 7c75a0cc6ba4f80bdb47df37d0aeab38681e621a5052507a5cc8da2a4eac332c: remove /home/vms/docker/overlay/cd7e50fe0e95feca8ced590c0ecd373290fa6710656db75286c1ce8900ff09d1/merged: device or resource busy ERROR: for rstudio driver \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; failed to remove root filesystem for 8f90d16c8da45c59519203e582917b24a4249fdfa9a35f5043782320d6d6b2d4: remove /home/vms/docker/overlay/408a938c07d53d5b4cf79376a15f1bf3ffc5cc54eb0c1d2f7f95215764e010b5/merged: device or resource busy ERROR: for shiny driver \u0026quot;overlay\u0026quot; failed to remove root filesystem for dc85077a54862940c0a17906b66d7670d1dbb95f5006083871c36c20586483f3: remove /home/vms/docker/overlay/08e22f468c2f5aa0ca4823a2aa5d9cb400167c49aa21a06f3538a9fa943c4dba/merged: device or resource busy Removing network dockerimages_default Removing network dockerimages_dspg  We got around this error by restart the server, which is far from an ideal solution,\nThere was a promising explanation here and here. Here\u0026rsquo;s an excerpt from Anusha Ragunathan\u0026rsquo;s post about what\u0026rsquo;s going on\nDug up some history: daemon flags changed to default \u0026quot;shared\u0026quot; mount propagation in 2aee081 in an effort to help volume mounts to ensure shared. This change made it to 1.12, which is probably why there's more reports since then. Prior to this, the flags were indeed set to \u0026quot;slave\u0026quot; in eb76cb2 to avoid EBUSY errors on container remove. There's a blog post on why this was done. Although it mentions devicemapper, the problem exists across graphdrivers. http://blog.hashbangbash.com/2014/11/docker-devicemapper-fix-for-device-or-resource-busy-ebusy/  Overview: While this is issue not exclusive to devicemapper, the mechanics currently involved in this driver cause it to be affected by this. A couple of the more commons issues seen when using the ‘devicemapper’ storage driver is when trying to stop and/or remove a contianer. In the docker daemon logs, you may see output like: [error] deviceset.go:792 Warning: error waiting for device ac05cffda663a01cbc37879bc146fcd68d0f95b5b141f60da2b64579add1f4ef to close: Timeout while waiting for device ac05cffda663a01cbc37879bc146fcd68d0f95b5b141f60da2b64579add1f4ef to close or more likely: Cannot destroy container ac05cffda663: Driver devicemapper failed to remove root filesystem ac05cffda663a01cbc37879bc146fcd68d0f95b5b141f60da2b64579add1f4ef: Device is Busy [8ad069f7] -job rm(ac05cffda663) = ERR (1) [error] server.go:1207 Handler for DELETE /containers/{name:.*} returned error: Cannot destroy container ac05cffda663: Driver devicemapper failed to remove root filesystem ac05cffda663a01cbc37879bc146fcd68d0f95b5b141f60da2b64579add1f4ef: Device is Busy [error] server.go:110 HTTP Error: statusCode=500 Cannot destroy container ac05cffda663: Driver devicemapper failed to remove root filesystem ac05cffda663a01cbc37879bc146fcd68d0f95b5b141f60da2b64579add1f4ef: Device is Busy Diagnosis: What’s happening behind the scenes is that devicemapper has established a new thin snapshot device to mount then container on. Sometime during the life of that container another PID on the host, unrelated to docker, has likely started and unshared some namespaces from the root namespace, namely the mount namespace (CLONE_NEWNS). In the mounts referenced in this unshared host PID, it includes the thin snapshot device and its mount for the container runtime. When the container goes to stop and unmount, while it may unmount the device from the root namespace, that umount does not propogate to the unshared host PID. When the container is removed, devicemapper attempts to remove the thin snapshot device, but since the unshared host PID includes a reference to the device in its mountinfo, the kernel sees the device as still busy (EBUSY). Despite the fact the mounts of the root mount namespace may no longer show this device and mount.  Maybe these problems can be fixed with a different container orchestration system like docker swarm or kubernetes, who knows.\n","date":1499385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"a5f04f41dcfbfcad88959b3c89af1542","permalink":"/2017/07/07/from-vms-to-lxc-containers-to-docker-containers/","publishdate":"2017-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/07/07/from-vms-to-lxc-containers-to-docker-containers/","section":"post","summary":"Since I\u0026rsquo;ve joined SDAL, the lab has undergone a few infrastructure related changes, mainly how applications are run on the servers.

I\u0026rsquo;ve created a simple shell script that automatically generates this folder structure here, and there\u0026rsquo;s an rr-init project by the Reproducible Science Curriculum folks.\nThe structure we have in our lab looks like this:\nproject | |- data # raw and primary data, are not changed once created | | | |- project_data # subfolder that links to an encrypted data storage container | | | | | |- original # raw data, will not be altered | | |- working # intermediate datasets from src code | + +- final # datasets used in analysis | |- src / # any programmatic code | |- user1 # user1 assigned to the project | +- user2 # user2 assigned to the project | |- output # all output and results from workflows and analyses | |- figures/ # graphs, likely designated for manuscript figures | |- pictures/ # diagrams, images, and other non-graph graphics | +- analysis/ # generated reports for (e.g. rmarkdown output) | |- README.md # the top level description of content | |- Makefile # Makefile, if applicable |- .gitignore # git ignore file +- project.Rproj # RStudio project  In the main level there are data, src, and output folders. As well as *.Rproj, .gitignore, and potentially a Makefile files.\nThe .Rproj file Since we are primarily an R lab that runs an RStudio Server server, we use the Rproj files organize the various projects. There are a few benefits to this. When using the RProj file, it sets the working directory in RStudio to the location of the Rproj file automatically. This makes the project more reproducible by avoiding the setwd() command in R, and since multiple people work on the same project, referencing other people\u0026rsquo;s source code and data outputs all stem from a common location.\nThe .gitignore file The .gitignore file is there to ignore various outputs from the src code. This includes things like .pdf or .html output from knitr and rmarkdown documents, as well as things in the first level of the data folder. In general, the files and folders in the .gitignore file are things that can be reproduced/regenerated by running code from the src folder.\nThe src folder The src folder contains all the analysis and code for the project. It should only contain the code for the project and not any kind of output from the code, i.e., data, reports, etc.. Since all the projects int he lab are separate git repositories, each person working on the project creates a separate folder with his/her user name (e.g. user1, user2) under the src directory to minimize potential conflicts within the code.\nThe output folder Is there for any type of \u0026lsquo;final\u0026rsquo; non-data output. The useage is ambiguous on purpose, but typically is used for some kind of plot or table that will be used in a final publication or report. the figures, pictures, and analysis subfolders are just placeholders about what could potentially be placed in the folder, users have the freedom to adapt the contents to the project at hand.\nThings in the output folder are, by default, ignored since the they should be able to be re-created with one of the src scripts.\nThe only thing that should not be in the output folder are any datasets. Those should all be under of the the data subfolders described below.\nThe data folder Since the data folder is part of the code repository, (i.e., it comes when you git clone the repository), the contents of the folder are, by default, ignored in the .gitignore file. Additionally, because of data privacy concerns, all of our project data are on separate (encrypted) LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) partitions. The data folder contains a shortcut to the relevant encrypted data container. This is one way to prevent data from being checked into the code repository, and potentially leaving the server.\nWithin the encrypted data folder, there are 3 main folders: original, working, and final. The original data are the rawest datasets available. Typically theses are datasets we are given by sponsors, or found online. These datasets, in combination with the code in src, should be able to regenerate any of the datasets in working and final.\nData provenance is the chronology of how data is transformed through the cleaning and analysis phase. It\u0026rsquo;s important for reproducibility/reproducibility, and means that original data should never be altered directly. original data should only be modified by the code in src. Also, because the original dataset is never altered, and bugs or alterations in the code can be fixed without compromising the integrity of the dataset.\nThe working data folder is mainly used for intermediate datasets. For example, when a particular data step takes \u0026ldquo;a long time\u0026rdquo; to run, the output of that datastep can be saved in the working directory and be used in a new R script to resume any additional data cleaning steps.\nThe final data folder is usually used for datasets that have been cleaned and ready for analysis. No dataset is every fully cleaned, you can probably always perform some other data transformation on it, but this folder is mainly reserved for datasets where an analysis, report, or plot is generated from.\nConclusion Project templates provide a standard for one to share code with other people. With a standardized folder structures, a new member of a project can easily start to understand where the data, code, documentation, and results are.\nIt also makes code reproducible/replicable and provides a common location (working directory) to run the code.\nFinally, because there are specifically designated areas for various components of a project, things become easier to find because everything is not simply placed in the same folder for \u0026ldquo;convenience\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":1496102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"4a223136a519cdbb81a996ea250a69a7","permalink":"/2017/05/30/project-templates/","publishdate":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/05/30/project-templates/","section":"post","summary":"Project templates provide some standardized way to organize files.

Before then, I only knew about Open Access and Open Source, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t active in any Open community.\nThis week is Open Data Week at Virginia Tech, and it begins with an \u0026ldquo;Open Research/Open Data Forum [on] Transparency, Sharing, and Reproducibility in Scholarship\u0026rdquo;, which I was honored to be apart of.\nOpen Access typically refers to providing research publications free from restrictions on access. In academic publishing, this is mainly aimed towards paywalls, where an individual needs to pay to see a published paper.\nThe debate around Open Access is highly debated, mainly because there is a lot of money in the scholarly publication business. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the mindset that Open Access or not, it is just a business funding model. The other components of Open (data, source, education) are better and faster ways of disseminate information to the masses without a fee.\nI am honored to be one of the panelists on today\u0026rsquo;s Open Data Forum:\n Daniel Chen (Ph.D. candidate in Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology) Karen DePauw (Vice President and Dean for Graduate Education) Sally Morton (Dean, College of Science) Jon Petters (Data Management Consultant, University Libraries) David Radcliffe (Professor, English, College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences) Laura Sands (Professor of Human Development, Center for Gerontology)  \u0026lsquo;Daunting\u0026rsquo; might not be the right word, but that\u0026rsquo;s quite the line-up of speakers + random graduate student. Someone at the libraries thought it was a good idea, and has faith in me, so that\u0026rsquo;s a plus.\nThe question presented to the panel:\n “One of the main arguments in favor of open research and open data is that the collective benefits to the research system far outweigh the drawbacks. Such benefits include helping to address the problem of reproducibility and opening up new research pathways. Do you agree with this argument? And what are the principal barriers you see in moving us towards this system?”\n It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting question, mainly because it seems like we are preaching to the choir, but one way to see the other side of the argument is looking at the current system of incentives. Currently, the way academic incentives are structured for promotion are not conducive for open collaboration and open data. Mainly because by freely diving out data, one may loose the ability for a paper authorship. Granted there are counter arguments for this, but fear is a powerful motivator, and when productivity is measured by number of publications, potentially losing publications is enough of a detractor for many to not pursuit Openness.\n","date":1491782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"5251e149ef3b208ed838f84b70d7be3b","permalink":"/2017/04/10/open-access/","publishdate":"2017-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/04/10/open-access/","section":"post","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Open\u0026rdquo; has played in important role in my life the last few years.

Software-Carpentry aims to teach the Best Practices for Scientific Computing.\nScientific computing is a skill lacking in education, especially in higher education where research is being performed. What is lacking in scientific computing education is the lack of courses for the researcher, rather than the computer scientist. I think this is why MOOCs came to existence, people found the current system of teaching courses too restrictive so they went outside the university and created the course they wanted. For example, trying to get a Software-Carpentry workshop as a university course is difficult because different departments around the university feel like its their jurisdiction to create the course (I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you computer science). However, faculty are already heavily burdened with trying to fund themselves with grants and performing other responsibilities as faculty, that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to create a generic multi-disciplinary course on scientific research. Also, assessing students is tricky in the software-carpentry context because of how many hours a class can meet per week. SWC works because it\u0026rsquo;s a very condensed 2 day workshop aimed to teach all the basics in Bash, Git, Python or R, and SQL. To formulate and re-arrange the workshop into a weekly course means many skills will not be integrated until the very end. In which case you risk loosing students. MOOCs are just a natural evolution to address the limitations in a university setting.\nMOOCs have their own problems, mainly attrition. Only a small fraction of the students who begin a MOOC complete it. I am guilty of starting courses and not finishing the course, or only hand-picking a few topics relevant to myself. But, I am happy to know the content is there for when I need to go back to it one day.\nI think many of the backlash towards MOOCs are the same criticisms regarding open eduction and open textbooks: how can something \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; be good? My response:\n How many teachers begin teaching Calculus I every September when the new school year begins? How many of those teachers are writing his/her own curriculum? How many of those teachers lean the same mistakes on their first year to fix on the next iteration? How many hours of resources were wasted for all the teachers to learn the same mistake? What if all that knowledge was already compiled into an open curriculum to be refined?  There are companies that teach MOOCs. DataCamp is an example. They have a subscription service where experts in a field aim to teach a programming concept. This allows companies to purchase bulk subscriptions for their employees to give them targeted training without having to come up with their own in-house resources.\nMaybe if we have people pay a dollar for a MOOC, they will feel obligated to finish the course?\n","date":1491177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"359ecdd65f97b4577ed69c0a5bdc1e13","permalink":"/2017/04/03/tech-innovation-in-higher-ed/","publishdate":"2017-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/04/03/tech-innovation-in-higher-ed/","section":"post","summary":"How faculty (higher education) are using and/or reacting to social media, MOOCs, and/or other \u0026ldquo;disruptive\u0026rdquo; technologies.\nOne of my favorite talks is the one given by Greg Wilson at Scipy 2014 about the lessons learned from Software-Carpentry.

At the very end of the post I mentioned ways we can extend the Watts model with neural-networks. Here I outline the steps of the neural-network simulation.\nGenerally the model goes though an initiation step, a simulation step, and a cleanup step. In the initiation step, the agents are created and connected in a network. Then selected agents are seeded with a value before continuing onto the simulation step. In the simulation step, \u0026lsquo;steps\u0026rsquo; for each time tick are performed. This includes picking agents to be updated, making the necessary calculations for an update, and updating agents in a simultaneous or sequential manner. Agent states in teach time tick is saved to be written to a (CSV) file. The cleanup step is mainly there when programming the model. It saves any unwritten states to the file, and any other related tasks of that nature.\nMANN The neural networks used in MANN use the \u0026ldquo;the light, efficient network simulator\u0026rdquo; (LENS). I created a (inefficient) python wrapper around LENS, pylens. This mainly stems from the fact my advisor used LENS for his work in the past, and interface with it via the command line with input files. The inefficient stems from the fact that I am having python write our the necessary input files for the neural network, and making command-line subprocess calls to LENS.\nInitiation $n$ agents are created for the model. When an agent is created, a feed-forward neural network with randomized weights to represent its state. A prototype that will be used to train the neural network is assigned to the agent.\nThe agent\u0026rsquo;s will all be connected to a network. For example in the networkx list of graph generators, the [fast_gnp_random_graph][5] takes the number of agents, $n$, and a probability, $p$, of an edge being created.\nTo train the neural network, it needs a set of example files to train. The example file consists of $k$ (50) examples. Each example is a randomized form of the prototype. The amount of randomization is determined by parameter $\\delta$. To incorporate heterogeneity in the model, we also mutate the prototype that is used to create the example files. This mutation rate is designated as $\\epsilon$.\nHow well the agent gets trained is parameterized with the criterion variable. It is analogous to the amount of error the neural network can make before it finishes training. That is, the smaller the criterion, the smaller the error, the more accurate it can represent the training set. All agents stop training after 1000 epochs (training cycles for the neural network).\nOnce the neural network is trained, its weights are output to a file to be loaded during the simulation step.\nAll agents begin with a state of 0. That is the first layer of the neural network all have values of 0. We then select agents to be seeded. The seeded agent is presented (via an example file) the non-$\\epsilon$-mutated prototype. We cycle this value through the neural network with one epoch, and the output of the neural network is assigned to the agent\u0026rsquo;s state.\nWe then begin the simulation part of the model.\nSimulation The simulation runs in steps. These steps designate the amount of time ticks the simulation runs for. The same process occurs during each time tick until the simulation ends.\nAll agents will be randomly selected (without replacement) to undergo an update process. The update process looks at all the agent\u0026rsquo;s neighbors with a directed edge coming into the selected agent (i.e., neighbors or predecessors), and randomly selects one of the agents to be the influencer.\nThe influencer writes our its current state as an example file. This example file is used by the agent\u0026rsquo;s neural network and the output is assigned as the agent\u0026rsquo;s new state.\nIn a sequential update process, the agent\u0026rsquo;s new state is assigned as described above. However, during simultaneous updating, the new state will be stored into a temporary state value, so that if the agent is used as an influencer to another agent, the original agent state value will be written out to the example file. In simultaneous updating, only after all agents have undergone the update process will they assign the temporary state as their new state.\nThe agent states are saved to a file at the end of the initiation step and the end of each simulation time tick.\n","date":1490832600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"11f13946754f78fb33d00898c437fd1e","permalink":"/2017/03/30/a-simple-neural-network-model/","publishdate":"2017-03-30T00:10:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/03/30/a-simple-neural-network-model/","section":"post","summary":"My previous blog post summarized the main points of the Watts 2002 paper.

My parents both studied Computer Science, and my dad holds a Master's in Computer Science and works as a software developer. Growing up, all my computers were company hand-me-downs, but it allowed me to be lucky enough to always have a computer in the house. I liked to tinker, not as a programmer, or hacker, but more of a user. As a child, one of the first things I'd do when I open a program would to find the preferences tab of a program, and learn what settings were available, and learn how to use a piece of software. I competed in the ThinkQuest Internet Challenge in the 5th grade, and co-authored an award winning website on Epilepsy. High School I was fortunate to attend Stuyvesant High School, a specialized math and science high school in NYC. One semester of programming was a mandatory for all sophomores. Looking back, I'm amazed the amount of material covered in a semester of school: Netlogo (where I co-wrote a BlackJack game), Scheme (where I wrote a visual calculator that worked with negative values, e.g., xx - xxx = -x), and Python (where I wrote a strategy for Prisoner's Dilemma). College My undergraduate years was focused on getting into medical school. I ended up graduating with a major in Psychology with a concentration in Behavioral Neuroscience, and minors in Biology and Computer Science. My high school experience in computer science was a bit traumatic, and prevented me from programming courses until my final couple of years in college. Bioinformatics was a major I was highly interested in, but the math and computer science requirements scared me into Psychology. I ended up in Behavioral Neuroscience because it was a small and new program mainly aimed towards the Honors Students. Still focused on getting into medical school, this was the best choice at the time since it gave me wet-lab experience and the chance to work closely with professors for letters of recommendation. During all of this I worked with Dr. Samuel Sigal in Hepatology at Wiel Cornell and NYU. I was on the clinical trials coordination team and got to interact with patients undergoing various Phase III clinical trials to cure Hepatitis C. Masters I got my Master's in Public Health because of the clinical research skills it would give me. It allowed me to build on the basic statistics knowledge I had from college, and learn the epidemiology and biostatistics skills for clinical and observational study design and regression analysis. I was lucky to be in the Department of Epidemiology when Sandro Galea was Chair of the department. Under his guide, the department had a big push to study complex systems approaches to public health. Here I got to work with Kerry Keyes, Magna Certa, and Melissa Tracy in a R01 studying injury from alcohol consumption in NYC. I also met Mark Orr, who became my Master's Thesis Advisor on measuring and simulating how behaviors spread in social networks. I learned to love teaching when I was a Quantitative Methods (Epidemiology I and Biostat I) Teaching Assistant for Dana March. This let me to join Software Carpentry when I after a workshop led by Justin Ely and David Wade Farley. I attended a Software Carpentry workshop when I took Introduction to Data Science during my Masters. The course was taught by Rachael Shutt, Kayur Patel, and Jared Lander. I learned R, and it changed my life. What started out as a Master's in Public Health to gain clinical research skills before going to medical school quickly evolved into Data Science where data analytics applied to health became my new interest. Now I\u0026rsquo;m currently at Virginia Tech in the Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology program. My lab, the Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory, is in Arlington, VA, and I occasionally have small consulting and side projects to help pay the bills and put guacamole on my Chipotle.\n","date":1489968000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"e903a859542c85f379db83c2fdfec84d","permalink":"/2017/03/20/my-story/","publishdate":"2017-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/03/20/my-story/","section":"post","summary":"How did I get to where I am today.\nThis is my story.\nEarly I've always been surrounded by computers.

The next step is thinking about expanding the binary decisions with externalities model to a psychological plausible decisions with externalities model. This has been the goal of the multi-agent neural-network (MANN) project.\nContext from the Watts model From an information diffusion perspective, a cascade is the spread of information from an initial set (seed) of individuals (nodes). Watts talks about features of a network that create a global cascade, which is simply a cascade of \u0026lsquo;sufficient\u0026rsquo; size. The ability for a node to receive and pass on a bit of information is it\u0026rsquo;s vulnerability.\nCascades are triggered by the interaction between 2 properties \u0026ndash; a network property (degree centrality) and a node property (threshold). If we look at these 2 properties as mutually exclusive from one another, then nodes with smaller degree centrality will be less vulnerable compared to nodes with higher degree centrality, and nodes with lower threshold values will be more vulnerable than nodes with higher threshold values. This is because nodes with fewer connections have a smaller probability of getting information passed onto it, and nodes with lower thresholds need fewer bits of information to propagate a signal.\nAlthough degree centrality (local dependencies) and (fractional) thresholds are integral parts of the binary decisions with externalities model, another key aspect is heterogeneity. For a given network, not every node will have the same degree centrality, and not every node will have the same fractional threshold value. As a matter of fact, any combination of high/low degree centrality and high/low fractional threshold is possible, and each combination has an effect on a particular node\u0026rsquo;s vulnerability.\n   Degree (k) Threshold ($\\phi$) Vulnerability     High High Low   High Low High   Low High Low   Low Low High    Expanding the Watts model with neural networks The next step is to explore ways the Watts model can be expanded. The rationale being decisions, and similarly, behaviors, are binary, but the process of making a decision and performing an action are not. Mark Orr, Roxanne Thrush, and David C. Plaut suggest incorporating the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) as the theoretical framework to describe how behaviors emerge and an auto-associator neural-network as the computational framework to simulate nodes.\nA neural network allows for a multi-dimensional node, not just a simple binary node. The key feature of an auto associative neural network is its ability to learn and reproduce an identity (a.k.a, prototype) given a portion of inputs. From the Wikipedia page, if we are presented the quote \u0026ldquo;I came, I saw\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, we should be able to complete the rest of the quote: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; I conquered\u0026rdquo;.\nIf we re-conceptualize the Watts model, the prototype is the bit of information each node can pass to its neighbors (i.e., a state of 1). Since this is a binary model, then each node can be thought to be trained to have an output of 1, but has a state of 0 until the proper inputs are met (local dependencies and fractional thresholds), and the node has a state of 1.\nFrom the neural network perspective, every node is trained to a particular prototype (e.g., the vector: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]), and has a state of 0 (e.g., the vector: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) until proper inputs are met, the neural network will output the prototype (e.g., the vector: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]). Additionally, the same output should be returned, if only a portion of the prototype vector is presented.\nCreating a neural network model analogous to the Watts model While there are many questions and solutions on how to relate the Watts model to this newly defined neural-network model, two immediately come to mind.\n How do we measure if information has been passed from one node to another? How do we map fractional thresholds between the two models?  Since we know the trained/learned prototype for each node, one way to know if information passed from the seed node (and subsequent nodes) to a new node is to look at how \u0026lsquo;similar\u0026rsquo; the output of the new node is to the prototype. Similarity can be measured in many ways, one such way is to use cosine similarity. Once the similarity is calculated, we can apply another threshold, $\\theta$, that signals the propagation of information. This new threshold can be used to calculate a binary state, $S_1$ that is analogous to the Watts model state, $S_0$. We can use $\\theta$ to calculate how many nodes are different from the node of interest (this can also be thought of as some function of $S_1$), and use the same threshold, $\\phi$, from the Watts model to determine whether the node of interest will propagate our signal in the network.\nHowever, since our definition of \u0026lsquo;similarity\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;information propagation\u0026rsquo; relies on the output of our neural network, we need to give the neural network a set of inputs. This leads to anther question:\n How do we provide inputs to nodes that have been designated to carry and propagate information in the network?  We can do this a few ways. For each node that will propagate information we can assign the input as\n the prototype (e.g., the vector: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]) the state (a.k.a output) of 1 of the \u0026lsquo;different\u0026rsquo; connected nodes the average state of all of the \u0026lsquo;different\u0026rsquo; connected nodes the average state of all connected nodes present each \u0026lsquo;different\u0026rsquo; node in a random order and have the neural network cycle though them present all connected nodes in a random order and have the neural network cycle though them  Other than the first option of using the prototype, the other methods will still preserve the differences in degree centrality between the nodes. For example, if a node only has one neighbor and it will be updated with 1 neighbor, it will always be presented with the same inputs. However if a node has multiple neighbors, the probability of the same neighbor picked every time is proportional to the number neighbors.\nCreating a simpler neural-network model A simpler approach would be to have each node in the network trained against the prototype. Seed a single node with the prototype, and run the model without any additional thresholding rule ($\\theta$), and have each node use a random 1 neighbor\u0026rsquo;s state (i.e., output) and its input.\n","date":1475107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"8f7a61ba35a4e95e34d80b8b7165714b","permalink":"/2016/09/29/expanding-the-watts-model/","publishdate":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2016/09/29/expanding-the-watts-model/","section":"post","summary":"I wrote a blog post and gave a seminar talk about the Watts 2002 paper.

In no way shape or form am I claiming the content below as my own work, it all comes from the paper\n Binary decisions with externalities is a general class of problems that can be used to model a wide variety of real-world problems.\n Cascades limited by connectivity\n Connectivity can play a role in global cascades. Fewer connections mean a lesser chance of information spreading within a network. The abstract references  power law cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory avalanches in self-organized criticality   Cascades limited by local stability\n When a network is highly connected, cascades will occur when a threshold number of connected nodes incorporate the information. Additionally, these types of networks have a bimodal distribution of a global cascade, either one will happen or it will not. When the threshold of agent\u0026rsquo;s to incorporate a bit of information is heterogeneous, the entire system has a higher chance of a global information cascade.  When the agent\u0026rsquo;s threshold is heterogeneous, the ones who have a lower threshold are more vulnerable.  Conversely, when the degree distribution is heterogeneous, the system is less likely to have a information cascade.  When an agent\u0026rsquo;s degree centrality is heterogeneous, the ones who have a higher degree will be less vulnerable.    The model Watts outlines has 3 unique features:\n local dependencies fractional thresholds heterogeneity  Network heterogeneity and threshold heterogeneity are not equivalent.\nGoals of the paper:\n Probability of a global cascade from a single node  Definitions  cascade: event of any size triggered by an initial seed global cascades: a cascade that occupies a finite fraction of an infinite network.

But throw a bunch of atoms together, and suddenly the story is entirely different. That\u0026rsquo;s why chemistry is a science of its own, not just a branch of physics. Moving farther up the chain of organization, molecular biology cannot be reduced simply to organic chemistry, and medical science is much more than the direct application of the biology of molecules. At a higher level still \u0026ndash; that of interacting organisms \u0026ndash; we encounter now a host of disciplines, from ecology and epidemiology, to sociology and economics, each of which comes with its own rules and principles that are not reducible to a mere knowledge of psychology and biology\n This juxtaposition depicts why studying complexity science and understanding system dynamics is crucial. Watts uses the 1996 blackouts in the United States as examples of how optimizing local infrastructure makes the entire system more fragile.\nThe more I progress academically and professionally, the more I realize the importance of Mathematics. As a statistician in training, I wish I wasn\u0026rsquo;t so focused in the life sciences in the past \u0026ndash; then again I had entirely different goals then.

It\u0026rsquo;s been a facinating experience and I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be a part of an open source movement promoting best practices. Typically when looking to start learing data science/analysis the first things people look up is something along the lines of: \u0026ldquo;learn python\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;free online r course\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;data science python\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;r jobs\u0026rdquo;, etc. Or scan through the coursera offerings. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit biased, but I think the SWC material is one of the best ways to just get familiar with the basics. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a blog post about SWC per se, but how one might go about learing and navigating some of the material on your own without attending a workshop.\nSoftware Carptentry Material SWC has a page of lessons that link to the various lessons taught during workshops. The core material covers:\n Unix Some programming language like Python, R, MATLAB, etc Version control using Git or Mercurial Databases and SQL  If you take a look and listen (there is sound) to the introductory browsercase. You will see that we say we teach the above material, but in essense we try to convey:\n Automation of repetitive tasks Tracking and sharing work Building modular code Manage data  It\u0026rsquo;s a little bait-and-switch :)\nInstalling Things For each SWC workshop is accompanied by a website. The website Contains information about location, instructors, helpers, syllabus, etc. For people reading this post, the most important part may be the installation instructions towards the middle/bottom of the page. There are separate instructions depending on your operating system.\nEssentially:\n Python: Anaconda R: R and RStudio  Navigating the Material For people who have not been to a workshop trying to navigate the lesson material can be tricky. And I would highly suggest going through at least the first 3 Unix lessons. This is mainly because loading files in a programming language uses the concept of relative and absolute paths, and it\u0026rsquo;s important to know where your data is and how to load it.\nUsing the R material as an example. The instructors typically teach from the Novice R Inflammation lessons. There has been some discussion and plans to use the Gapminder data to teach lessons. The beta can be found in the R Novice Gapminder lesson.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re on the github page of the lesson, there are a few ways to get the lessons plan\n If you know your way around git, you can clone the repository Otherwise, you will see an option to \u0026ldquo;Download ZIP\u0026rdquo; on the right panel. View them in the browser  The first 2 methods get you do the same place \u0026ndash; have the lessons on your computer. In order to view the lessons, open up the folder and all the lessons are numbered and end in .html. Click, read, and code through them in order.\nIf you want to view the lessons online, you can click the .Rmd documents, and github should be able to render the lesson for you in the browser. For Python and other materials, use the .md documents. The caveat with viewing the .Rmd and .md (aka R markdown, and markdown respectively) is that it does not render the documently exactly the same way as the .html files. There is a potential for things to be rendered incorrectly, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see some bizzare (YAML) header on the top. It\u0026rsquo;s great for a quick reference when you\u0026rsquo;re not at your computer, but I would suggest using one of the .html methods.\nData Carpentry Material Software Carpentry\u0026rsquo;s sister organization, Data Carpentry also has a set of lesson plans. From their about us page:\n Data Carpentry is a sister organization of Software Carpentry designed to teach basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data. We develop curricula and run workshops that are 1) domain specific; 2) target fundamental data analysis and data management challenges; and 3) require little or no prior programming experience. In many domains of research the rapid generation of large amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. The deluge of data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analyzing and sharing data. Data Carpentry aims to teach the data skills that will enable researchers to be more effective and productive.\n Pick a language you want to do the lesson with. clone or Download ZIP, and go through the lessons using the .html, .Rmd, or .md as mentioned above.\nHappy Learning! Hopefully this has been clear enough. If not, post a comment, and I\u0026rsquo;ll respond and update this post accordinly.\n","date":1430784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"37fe490384cff41614e6919927ea233a","permalink":"/2015/05/05/getting-started-with-data-science-and-analysis/","publishdate":"2015-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2015/05/05/getting-started-with-data-science-and-analysis/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been an instructor for Software-Carpentry (SWC) over a year now.

In this post I discuss the background, rational, and inital steps in my open source struggles. In part II I discuss automatic project and code documentation.\nBackground I had already been involved with Software Carpentry (SWC) for about 8 months when I started the project, so many of the concepts I just listed were not entirely foreign, just a matter of implementation. Thanks to a workshop by Gabriel Perez-Giz at NYU earlier that summer, I took it upon myself to practice my EMACS and setup elpy as my IDE. A development environment that can be used within a terminal was especially important, because the simulations I would be running would all be on a remote server.\nFor git, it was getting into the habit of not committing directly to master. For Python, I\u0026rsquo;d write a suite of unit tests for the first time, and I figured if I write some comments and docstrings I can get a nice document from it (I was wrong about that). Finally, I wanted to get those cool little badges people have on their github repo about build status, coverage, etc. That\u0026rsquo;s when I found an awesome blog post by Jeff Knupp titled \u0026lsquo;Open Sourcing a Python Project the Right Way\u0026rsquo;.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an amazing read if you are ready to take your programming practices to the next step. Jeff references a cookie-cutter that will setup the python project boilerplate, but I opted to just follow the blog post and do everything manually so I can have a better understanding as to what is going on in the background. Plus, this lets me slowly add features, rather than have an entire repo loaded with unknown files. More important, I added a few other things to make my project \u0026lsquo;better\u0026rsquo;:\n Use the git-flow paradigm to add new features Continuous integration (with TravisCI) Test your package with other versions of Python (using Tox) Code documentation with Sphinx and Read the Docs  I opted not to use Tox locally (at least not yet). TravisCI is handling my Python compatibility since I was working with Python 3.4, and was not going to have Python 2 support. I added a build for Python 3.4 and 3.3, and called it a day. Also I opted to use nosetests instead of pytest since that\u0026rsquo;s what I was shown when I helped out at the MIT SWC workshop. That, plus there was SWC material, and other big open source projects use it, was my rational to stick with nosetests.\n My project The original Multi-Agent Neural Network (MANN) project had a main.py script that loaded in my modules for the individual agents and the network structure. Everything was placed under the mann folder in the repo, with no subfolders. When I eventually realized that I wanted the project to be PyPI ready, I wanted to separate the main program logic (the MANN code) from the actual script that sets up the simulation. I eventually moved the main.py script (and all required files) into the Multidisciplinary Diffusion Model Experiments (MDME) repo.\nPrerequisites I\u0026rsquo;ve realized the more I program in python, the more invaluable virtual environments are when developing packages. A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places while simultaneously keeping your base python distribution clean and working should something go awry. They also allow you to flip between Python 2 and Python 3 depending on what version a piece of code you are trying to run was written in. Pretty cool stuff.\nThe Python distribution I use is called Anaconda.\nSetting up virtual environments using conda:\nconda create -n VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME python=3.4\nYou can specify different versions of python and/or pre-create environments with a set of modules if needed.\nSwitching between environments: source activate VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME\nTo exit out of an environment: source deactivate.\nYou can read up more about creating environments on the conda documentation\n Createing Python 2\u0026frasl;3 environments conda create Python Packages and Environments with conda  Issues Turning a current python project into a \u0026lsquo;module\u0026rsquo; can break a few things. It is as simple as putting a __init__.py into a directory to signify that the contents of the folder is now a Python module, but there can be some weird side-effects.\nUnit tests When you turn your project into a package, you will find that if you run nosetests it will start running the unit tests for all the modules you load (if they have any).\nFor example I was initially using\nnosetests --cover-branches --with-coverage\nto test my code, but I had to add the --cover-package=MODULE_NAME to get it to only test the code in my module:\nnosetests --cover-branches --with-coverage --cover-erase --cover-package=mann\nImporting Modules Since I\u0026rsquo;ve moved out my simulation code from the code that defines that MANN module, I had to install the MANN module. One way to do it is to upload the code to PyPI and pip install the package. The problem is when you want to load a module to PyPI you essentially need to have a git tag associated with the version you want. This is problematic when you are rapidly prototyping since you\u0026rsquo;ll need to either delete tags, or constantly increment the tag. You\u0026rsquo;ll end up with a v.0.314.0 very quickly. You can do a local install of your module by going to where you have the setup.py file and doing:\npython setup.py install\nThis is why virtual environments are really helpful.\n You won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about cluttering the base Python distribution and modules with your \u0026lsquo;test\u0026rsquo; code. You can test your code before uploading it to PyPI (or anywhere else). This is really helpful becuase PyPI requires you to have a tag. Doing a local install allows you to workout any potential bugs before submitting a release so you won\u0026rsquo;t have to have 15 release numbers for your first release.

A few days later, after the post went viral, the MTA responded by saying this is so there will be enough change in the machine for cash users and this will be addressed next year after the new fare increase.\nBen suggested to us all to remember $9.55, $19.05, and $38.10 to get a MetroCard that will yield us a $0.00 card at the end. Among all the comments I saw going around my social media feeds, one of the comments that I saw was how remembering these magic numbers are great, but people are still annoyed that there will always be a few cents left over depending on when you read about the magic fares.\nIf we look closer at the table Ben shared (partially reproduced below), and take in to account the fact that the kiosks will only take in whole nickel values (i.e., values that end in either 5 or 0), we can see one thing\u0026hellip;\n   # Rides You Pay ($) On Card ($) Remainder ($)     1 2.40 2.52 0.02   2 4.80 5.04 0.04   3 7.15 7.51 0.01   4 9.55 10.03 0.03   5 11.90 12.50 0.00   8 19.05 20.00 0.00   13 30.95 32.50 0.00    \u0026hellip; there are ways for us to generate $0.01, $0.02, $0.03, and $0.04 remainders in our card! What does that mean for us? It means regardless of how many leftover cents your card will have, there is always a way to get it up to a whole nickel value. From there we can input one of the three magical values plus the amount needed to get you to a whole nickel value + how much you are currently short.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s walk through an example.\nYou buy a \u0026lsquo;Fast $9 MetroCard\u0026rsquo;, You end up with $9.45 on it. By the time you\u0026rsquo;ve used it to exhaustion, you will have $1.95 on it. You are \u0026lsquo;short\u0026rsquo; $2.50 - $1.95 = $0.55. So you go to the kiosk and put in $19.05 + $0.55 = $19.60, and voilà. You now have an 9 ride MetroCard.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you have a MetroCard laying around with $0.01 on it. We know we need $0.04 to get a whole nickel value. We can look up on the table some value that gives us $0.04, so we add $4.80 on the card. This gives us a $5.05 MetroCard. Nice! we have a whole nickel amount. If we use this card to exhaustion, we will end with $0.05, leaving us short $2.45 for the next full ride. We can now use one of the 3 magical numbers in conjunction with the $2.45 to get us a MetroCard bound for $0.00.\nIf you wanted to do this all in one go\u0026hellip; is we added $4.80 + $2.45 + $19.05 = $26.30 to to our card.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t accounted for any weird 5% bonuses the kiosks may/may not give you. But the premise is simple, use one of the pre-calculated values to \u0026lsquo;nickel-out\u0026rsquo; your card, then use one of the magic values + difference and you\u0026rsquo;ll have one fewer thing to be worried about.\n","date":1412023200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"1fbb0d367cc5ef21170be0205d6d562c","permalink":"/2014/09/29/hacking-your-metrocard-to-0.00/","publishdate":"2014-09-29T20:40:00Z","relpermalink":"/2014/09/29/hacking-your-metrocard-to-0.00/","section":"post","summary":"Earlier this month, Ben Wellington wrote a blog post about How Memorizing “$19.05” Can Help You Outsmart the MTA.

A problem arises when multiple files needed to be downloaded simultaneously. One simply cannot just select the files and bulk download them. Courseworks have instructions to circumvent this limitation in the web interface by implementing a WebDAV client. However, other than Cyberduck under their Mac instructions, the Windows suggestion is quite limited.\nIn this post I discuss setting up a WebDAV Client for Windows and Mac. If you are on Linux, I\u0026rsquo;ve only used AnyClient, which is Java based but is not as comprehensive as the Windows/Mac alternatives suggested in this post (and this is the one suggested by Courseworks). If anyone knows of a good Linux WebDAV client, let me know!\nThis post shows how to setup BitKinex and Cyberduck in Windows. You can also use the Cyberduck instructions for Mac.\nCourseworks also has instructions on setting up Cyberduck under their Mac section; the same instructions can also be used for the Windows version of Cyberduck.\nBe careful when accessing a directory that you do not own. There is the potential that you may be able to upload files to the directory, or worse, change, overwrite, or delete the files.\nStep 1: Accessing your Courseworks files and resources links.\nWhat you have to do first is log into your Coureworks, click on the course number for your class and then in the left frame of the page click \u0026ldquo;Files \u0026amp; Resources\u0026rdquo;. On the top of the page you will see a link for \u0026ldquo;upload-download multiple resources\u0026rdquo;, see figure 1.1\n Figure 1.1: Upload-Download Multiple Resources Link It will direct you do a link to copy in \u0026ldquo;step 1\u0026rdquo; and directions to set up WebDAV in \u0026ldquo;step 2\u0026rdquo;. In \u0026ldquo;step 2\u0026rdquo; you will find the instructions for setting up Cyberduck for Mac, which is the same for windows (like I mentioned above).\nThe link that you need essentially has 2 parts, the part that is highlighted in Figure 1.2 is what you will need when you are using BitKinex, the entire link is needed for Cyberduck,\n Figure 1.2: components of your WebDAV directory Step 2a Windows:\nFor Windows I use Bitkinex. You can also use Cyberduck (which I describe in the Mac section below).\nYou can download BitKinex here. At the time of this post Current Version: 3.2.3 Release Date: 07/11/2010. Do not worry about the \u0026lsquo;older\u0026rsquo; release date.\nAfter you have BitKinex installed, you will right click \u0026ldquo;Http/WebDAV\u0026rdquo; and go to New \u0026gt; Http/WebDav, See figure 2.1 (sorry my mouse is highlighted over the wrong option).\n[][5]\nFigure 2.1: Creating a new WebDAV connection in BitKinex A popup window will appear for a name, you can simply put \u0026ldquo;Columbia\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;newcourseworks.columbia.edu\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;courseworks.columbia.edu\u0026rdquo;.\nNext, it should direct you to a settings menu under the \u0026ldquo;Server\u0026rdquo; option on the left, See Figure 2.2. for server address enter \u0026ldquo;courseworks.columbia.edu\u0026rdquo;, I used \u0026ldquo;newcourseworks.columbia.edu\u0026rdquo;, but I believe the two should be the same, and the former may be preferred. You can also refer to Step 1 and copy the text I showed that was not highlighted in blue (Figure 1.2). Under Authentication, enter your UNI for \u0026ldquo;User\u0026rdquo; and password for \u0026ldquo;Password\u0026rdquo;\n[][6]\nFigure 2.2: WebDAV Setup Now go back to the Step 1, and Figure 1.2, and select the part of the link that I have selected in blue. It should start with a \"/dav/...\". On the left hand panel under \"Server\" there should be a section called \"Site Map\". Paste the text you just copied into the textfild and select \"Directory (WebDAV complient)\" and click Add. Repeat this process for all your courses. See figure 2.3 for more details.  Figure 2.3: Course Folder Directory Setup Here is what BitKinex looks like after you double click on \"newcourseworks.columbia.edu\" under the \"Http/WebDAV\" section of the initial main application screen (See figure 2.4). The application has 3 main panels. The one on the far left shows a directory tree to everything you input shown in Figure 2.3. The middle shows the file contents as you navigate the folders, you can double click the folder with two dots \"..\" to move up to the parent folder (the folder you just came from). The right panel shows contents on your computer. There is a small area with green and blue buttons that may/may not be greyed out. These let you move files to your computer or upload to the server. You can hover over them for more details.  Figure 2.4: Using BitKinex Now you should be able to go to your course's files and select everything (or everything you need) and just click the green button, and it will automatically download everything over. Just take note that sometimes professors have very long names for their PDF's and depending where on your computer you are downloading the file to, it may not save. Most of the time it is because the entire file path and name is over 256 characters. What you have to do then is just navigate to your desktop on the right panel, download the file there, and then rename it before moving it to the directory of your choice. On the top of the window you can also set folder favorites, so you can easily navigate, to say, your \"Columbia\" folder quicker. Step 2b Mac:\nCyberduck can be found here. I am using the Windows version of Cyberduck, the Mac should look almost the same.\nCourseworks have the following instructions on their site:\n Click the Open Connection button. In the *Server* dialog box, type (or copy and paste) the path as shown above. Type in your Sakai username and password and click OK.  You will now see a window on your Mac screen that represents the resources that are in your site. Simply drag and drop between this window and other Finder windows on your Mac to transfer files to and from your Sakai site\u0026rsquo;s resources folder.\nI will be showing a different method, all have the same results.\nOn the bottom left of the application, click on the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; sign (Figure 3.1)\n Figure 3.1: Adding a bookmark Next, choose \"WebDAV(HTTP/SSL)\" from the drop down menu, then give your course a name in \"Nickname\" and you can paste everything from the Courseworks link under \"Server\". Not everything will paste, but click the little arrow on the bottom left and the menu will expand and the remaining of the pasted text will be shown under \"Path\", if not you can manually paste the non-highlighted text I showed in Figure 1.2 to \"Server\", and the highlighted text to \"Path\". Your results should look similar to figure 3.2 below.  Figure 3.2: Setting up Cyberduck Connections Finally, just close that window and you should see your class listed in the Bookmarks section, figure 3.3. You can now double click the \"drive\" and it will open up the Courseworks files and you can click and drag to your folders on your computer.

A problem arises when multiple files needed to be downloaded simultaneously. One simply cannot just select the files and bulk download them. Courseworks have instructions to circumvent this limitation in the web interface by implementing a WebDAV client. However, other than Cyberduck under their Mac instructions, the Windows suggestion is quite limited.\nIn this post I discuss setting up a WebDAV Client for Windows and Mac.","tags":["tutorials","Client","Linux","Mac","Setup","WebDAV","Windows"],"title":"Setting up a WebDAV Client for Courseworks","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Chen","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

VirtualBox (VB) Intaller here:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\n CD or ISO of OS (for my CUMC/CU friends you can find the windows XP ISO here:\nhttp://cuit.columbia.edu/cuit/software-downloads/operating-system-software/windows-xp  The VB version I am using is 4.2.6\nAfter Installing VB. You want to click \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; in the toolbar. You will be given a setup dialogue.\nName and operating System:\nGive your virtual machine (VM) a name (i.e. Windows XP). Make sure Type is \u0026ldquo;Microsoft Windows\u0026rdquo; and Version is \u0026ldquo;Windows XP\u0026rdquo; (Note: you can install other operating systems and/or different version of windows, just set those dropdown menu\u0026rsquo;s accordingly).\nMemory size:\nBy default, VB set my WinXP VM to have 192 MB. Depending on how much RAM (memory) your computer has and programs you want to run you can increase it. For the most part you can leave it as is.\nHard drive:\nYour VM is essentially a computer, and computers need hard drives!\nclick the radio button for \u0026ldquo;create a virtual hard drive now\u0026rdquo;\nanother setup window will popup. Just leave the Hard drive file type as VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image). Leave the storage on physical hard drive as \u0026ldquo;dynamically allocated\u0026rdquo;. This will allow the VM to take up only enough space as needed and allow it to grow/shrink as needed. The file location and size should default the same as your VM name and 10.00GB. You can leave this at its defaults unless you know you will be saving and emulating a lot of programs in your VM. We will be setting up shared folders later so you can access your regular files on your computer without having copies in your VM. You just need enough space to install your OS and whatever programs you will be running. 10GB should be more than enough.\nYour new VM will show up on the left panel in VB. Select it and click the Start button in the toolbar. Your VM will load and a dialogue box will appear telling you that when your VM is active it will capture your mouse so it can be used within the VM. Dismiss the message with \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;.\nSet up Start up Disk. On my computer it defaulted to G:, just hit OK and let your VM load. You will eventually run into a message saying \u0026ldquo;FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted.\u0026rdquo; In your VM go to Devices \u0026gt; CD/DVD Devices \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file\u0026rdquo;.\n[][3]\nNavigate to and select your OS ISO file you downloaded earlier. Then go to Machine \u0026gt; Reset. Your VM will restart and if you are installing Windows XP, The screen will Turn Blue and will begin the Windows XP installation process.\nYou will eventually end up on this screen:\n[][4]\nOn the bottom you will see the keyboard commands to navigate through the menus. Press \u0026ldquo;ENTER\u0026rdquo; to install. Then select the first option \u0026ldquo;Format the partition using the NTFS file system \u0026rdquo; and hit ENTER. Windows will begin installing your VM. Sit tight. get some coffee. The system will restart on its own when it is ready to setup your OS. Eventually you will end up here:\n[][5]\nClick Next, and accept the agreement, and just keep clicking next (unless you know what you are doing). Give your name, you can give your VM a name, leave your administrator password blank, set up your time, and NEXT your way through the install. More coffee!\nEventually, you will go into the initial Windows user setup pages. You don\u0026rsquo;t need automatic updating, skip the internet setup, and enter your username. Click Finish and windows will load up.\nFirst think you may have noticed is that when you resize the VM window, it does not scale nicely. To fix this and also setup folder and USB access, and other things to make your VM integrate seamlessly, you have to install Guest Additions.\nIf you go to Devices \u0026gt; CD/DVD Devices (as you did earlier) your OS .ISO should be selected. Then go to Devices \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Install Guest Additions. Click next and install the files. When a dialogue box pops up saying that the software has not passed Windows Logo testing, just click \u0026ldquo;Continue Anyway\u0026rdquo;. Click FINISH and reboot your VM afterwards.\nWhen your VM reloads, go to View \u0026gt; Auto-resize Guest Display is checked. Your VM will now auto-resize.\nSetting up Shared folders. This will allow you to access your main OS files and folders within your VM without having to use programs such as dropbox to sync files in your VM. This also saves you a lot of space since you do not need to have duplicated files taking up HDD space. To do this, go to Devices \u0026gt; Shared Folders\u0026hellip;\n[][6]\nClick on the folder with a + icon. Select \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; in the Folder Path dropdown and navigate to a folder you want access to in your VM. I suggest you at least pick your main HDD folder (C:\\ in windows). When you are done Click OK and make sure \u0026ldquo;Auto-mount\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Make Permanent\u0026rdquo; check boxes are checked in your Add Share Window. This will automatically mount these folders every time you run your VM. Add as many folders as you need, especially folders that you commonly access.\nFinally under Devices menu bar, make sure \u0026ldquo;Shared Clipboard\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Drag\u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; have \u0026ldquo;Bi-directional\u0026rdquo; checked. Finally Restart the VM to apply your settings. Your shared folders will appear as network drives after you restart when you open up \u0026ldquo;My Computer\u0026rdquo;. You will also be able to move files around between VM easily, and things you copy will paste in your main OS. This is useful if you are running SAS in your VM and want to paste the output into your word document in your main OS.\nIf you want access to a USB drive that is plugged into your computer in your VM, go to Devices \u0026gt; USB Devices and select your drive. It will unmount from your main OS and mount it in your VM.\nFinally, if you want you can go to View \u0026gt; Switch to seamless mode to just have the app you are running in your VM without having the rest of your VM. Just pay attention to the dialogue box that pops up after you do this, it will tell you how to get back to your regular VM window.\n[3]: {{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/01-pickISO.png [4]: {{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/02-setup01.png [5]: {{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/03-setup02.png [6]: {{ site.baseurl }}/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/04-VMsetup.png\n","date":1361404800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563929150,"objectID":"cac6edae1fe0f113dc18bae4a0461e37","permalink":"/2013/02/21/setting-up-virtualbox/","publishdate":"2013-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2013/02/21/setting-up-virtualbox/","section":"post","summary":"Edit: March 31, 2014: As an assignment for Software Carpentry I made a screencast to follow along with these steps, here\nInstalling Windows XP in VirtualBox:\nFiles needed:\n1.
